            With the support of TEDx, and other influential community organizations, we would like to  introduce “Mind Makers”, an unconventional educational initiative created by a NASA JPL engineer to help expand the future of the STEM field community.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Under the mentorship of engineers from some of the most creative companies in the country, adult participants from underrepresented or unconventional backgrounds will be introduced to concepts that are key to developing technology. This will be done through specially designed virtual and in-person lessons and workshops which start out assuming that the new apprentices have no prior engineering knowledge and finish after several weeks of engagement and support, leaving them with practical yet powerful skills. Some of these new skills include elements of robotics, computer programing, CAD, electrical and mechanical engineering. Once completed, all of this valuable content and individual experiences will be provided as open-source resources.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Next, they will apply their newly learned know-how to work in a team to build a large scale interactive exhibit to be shared with the whole community. The exhibit will take the form of an automated human head, providing a responsive reproduction of our own biological sensory system (eyes, ears, brain and more) that helps us to perceive the world around us.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            The exhibit will expose children and adults to two beautiful concepts. One is that magic can be made by combining STEM knowledge with mentorship. The other, is that truly anyone can take part in this magic and then make more by passing it on to others. The overall process will result in a propagating wave of information sharing and encouragement between people from unexpected backgrounds, redefining what it means to be into engineering.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Together, we can empower all generations with the gifts of knowledge and show that impactful people are everywhere around us.
